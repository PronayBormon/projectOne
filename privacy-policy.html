                    <h5>6. Children’s Privacy</h5>
                    <p>Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly
                        collect or solicit personal information from children under 18. If we learn that we have
                        collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as
                        quickly as possible.</p>

                    <h5>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h5>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to
                        our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any
                        changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy
                        Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are
                        posted on this page.</p>

                    <h5>8. Contact Us</h5>
                    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <h5>9. Data Retention</h5>
                    <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to ensure the purposes
                        set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
                        (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate
                        business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or

                        anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
                        been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
                        isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    <h5>10. Additional Information</h5>
                    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection
                        rights. Ocean Trade aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or
                        limit the use of your personal information.</p>
